# C++ Demo

Some C++ Code I worked on whilst following [this](https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI?si=SvhzqOzuNlTf9knR) tutorial.

I would not reccomend running any of this code it soley exists for me to use as reference for C++ and it is not designed to run with all the seperate sections merged together.

Any practise programs were excluded and the following changes to the structure was made:

- 'Consts(3)' was put under 'Variables(2)'
- 'Variable Scope(29)' was put under 'Variables(2)'
- 'Consts paramets(45) info was put into 'Variables(2)'
<br> ㅤ
- 'Do While Loops(19)' was put under 'While Loops(18)'
- 'Return(27)' was put under 'Functions(26)'
- 'Null Pointers(48)' was put under 'Pointers(47)'
- 'Pass structs as args(54)' was put under 'Structs(53)'
- 'Overloading Constructors(58)' was put under 'Constructors(57)'
- 'Inheritance(60)' was put under 'OOP(56)'
<br> ㅤ
- 'Iterate Over an Array(34)' was put under 'Arrays(32)'
- 'For Each Loops(35)' was put under 'Arrays(32)'
- 'Passing Arrays to Functions(36)' was put under 'Arrays(32)'
- 'Searching an Array(37)' was put under 'Arrays(32)'
- 'Sorting an Array(38)' was put under 'Arrays(32)'
- 'Fill(39)' was put under 'Arrays(32)'
- 'Filling Arrays with Inputs(40)' was put under 'Arrays(32)'
- 'Multi-Dimension Array(41)' was put under 'Arrays(32)'
<br> ㅤ
- 'Type Conversion(7)' was excluded
